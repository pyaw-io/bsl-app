Background
The idea for this project was borne out of the need to get an easier was to monitor the blood sugar levels of people living with diabeties. As some who knows a few people who carry around blood sugar measuring devices and a notepads for recordings, I always wondered why they don't get an app to record the measurement and also make it easier to track their sugar levels more accurately. After a discussion with a friend with diabetes and an offer to get him an app that could replace his old notepad used for recording the figures, I set out to search for such an app. AFter hours of searching, I realised why they still used the notepads, most of the apps were general diabetic management app which concentrated on other important areas of managing diabeties like taking insulin,exercise and food choises. The apps that provided the option to record sugar levels we usually addons to these apps and didn't provide an easier wasy to record and monitor the measured level. This challenge prompted me to create this app, which not only records the sugar levels but create an graph out of the data received to present the user with a general idea on  their sugar levels over a period of time.

What Can the App Do
- users can instantly record their blood sugar levels anytime on any smart device
- users can set target for particular period to compare witha actual level they record
- on larger screen devices like tablets and computer, users are presented with line graphs of their recordings over time.
- user can backdate new recording incase they forgot to record any measurement the same day


What Tech Stack was Used
The app was built using react for the frontend for these reasons; 
- To create a smooth and fast user experience
- To prevent unecessary reloading of the whole app anytime the state changes
- To make it easier to maintain and add new features as they become necessary
 React-redux was used fro the state management

The backend of the app was build on firebase
- Firebase from google already has an advanced system in place to manage user authentication and app data
- I chose firebase to create a lightweight user authentication and data management solution without sacrificing data security 


What Can be Inporoved
- Addition of option for user to share record with others for examaple, medical professionals
